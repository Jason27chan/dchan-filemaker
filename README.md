I made this project for my uncle

The problem is that my uncle needs to generate a series of csv files with specific names.

For example, given the following csv file

| name    | property 1 | property 2 |
|---------|------------|------------|
| name1   | ...        | ...        |
| name2   | ...        | ...        |
| name3   | ...        | ...        |

We would like to generate the following files
* name1.csv
* name2.csv
* name3.csv
