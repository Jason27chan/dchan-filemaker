# MVP 1
## Story
1. User will move a python executable into the folder with the CSV containing the 
names of the files to be generated. 
2. User will execute the file by clicking on it
3. A window will pop up with some information about the application. The window 
will have a button that will initiate the file generation process
4. User will click on the button. The button will close the window
5. The new files will be generated in a folder called "data"

## Notes
The base file must have a specific name like "base_file.csv"

## Future goals
* User can denote the path to the file 
    * This feature would eliminate the awkwardness of needing to have a specific 
    name and path for the file
* Error-checking if the selected file is a csv
